    <h1>CASE STUDY</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        The client, operating in the advertising sector, relied heavily on a web booking application as a content management system for storing and managing advertisements. This application allowed end customers to view, select, and submit ad requests, making it essential for the application to function flawlessly to avoid costly errors in ad placements.
    </p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
        The company faced significant risks due to the potential for defects in the ad content submission module, which could lead to incorrect ad displays or failures in campaign messaging. Given the competitive nature of the advertising industry, any malfunction could result in financial losses and damage to client relationships.
    </p> 
    
    <h2>Implementation of Functional Testing</h2>
    <p>
        The company engaged a software testing partner to perform comprehensive functional testing on the web application to mitigate these risks. The testing process included:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Test Strategy Development: The testing team defined the test scope and types, focusing on key functionalities that affected user experience. They categorised tests based on client requirements and developed approximately 14 initial test cases.</li>
        <li>API Testing: Given that the application relied heavily on APIs for ad content management, rigorous API testing was conducted to ensure stability and performance.</li>
        <li>Iterative Testing Approach: The testing was structured in sprint cycles, allowing for continuous integration of new requests and immediate testing of changes. Each request was tracked through Jira, and testing was performed concurrently with development.</li>
        <li>Review Cycles: Multiple review cycles were established to ensure that all requirements were met and that no critical defects were overlooked.</li>
        <li>Ad Performance Testing: The testing included scenarios that accounted for various rules based on location, time of day, and other parameters to ensure that ads would display correctly under all conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The thorough functional testing process significantly reduced the number of production issues, leading to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Error-Free Launch: The application was launched without major defects, ensuring a seamless experience for end customers.</li>
        <li>Cost and Time Savings: By identifying and resolving issues early in the development cycle, the company saved on potential costs associated with post-launch fixes and client dissatisfaction.</li>
        <li>Increased Client Trust: The successful deployment of the application enhanced the clientâ€™s reputation in the market, reinforcing trust among advertisers and end customers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This case study illustrates the critical role of functional testing in software development, particularly in high-stakes environments like the advertising industry. By implementing a robust testing strategy, the company not only prevented major failures but also positioned itself for future success in a competitive market.</p>
